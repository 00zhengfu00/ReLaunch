ReLaunch - filemanager / launcher for Nook Simple Touch.

This is a filenamager and/or launcher for Nook Simple Touch. It calls
predefined reader on file selection, In addition it has task manager, task killer,
application manager and file viewer/editor functionality.

The tool is able to work in two modes:

1. Application mode
-------------------
When ReLaunch is invoked from other launcher it work like very simple filemanager.
The only action it can perform on file selection - call another application (usually reader)
with that file.

2. Launcher mode
----------------
When ReLanuch is invoked from SoftKey "home" button, or by pressing "Nook button - > Shop" or
"Nook button - > Library" it works in launcher mode. In that mode it has all standard launcher
functionality (task manager / application manager) in addition to application mode possibilities.

Notes
-----
Note 1: I build it in debug mode using eclipse. Do not forget to copy
debug.keystore to ~/.android in order to be compatible with old version
