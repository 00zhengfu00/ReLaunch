Nook Touch reader launcher

It looks like very simple Android filemanager which performs only one action -
it starts predefined application with this file passed vis setData().

It may be usable for Nook Touch when the predefined application is reader (like
FBReader, NomadReader, etc.).

I build it in debug mode using eclipse. Do not forget to copy debug.keystore
to ~/.android in order to be compatible with old version
