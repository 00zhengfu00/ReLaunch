Nook Touch reader launcher

It looks like very simple Android filemanager which is able to performs only one
action - it starts predefined application with selected file passed vis setData().

It may be usable for Nook Touch when the predefined application is reader (like
FBReader, NomadReader, etc.).

Note 1: I build it in debug mode using eclipse. Do not forget to copy
debug.keystore to ~/.android in order to be compatible with old version
