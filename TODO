- (NOT POPULATED, BEFORE 1.3!!!) add screens for "Help" and "Appreciation" (with links, for example, to CoolReader, icons lib pack and so on).
FUTURE >1.3

- (delayed at least for 1.3) add manual scrolling for Sony devices
- (delayed at least for 1.3) save configuration to sdcard (for restore) and save library state (fav, lru and so on)
	in library (with restore ability), so user may save state, edit library with external 
	filemanager and then restore state.
